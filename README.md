The Byrd MR App

Byrd MR is a front-end app that showcases a drone.

App is created using React, and utilizing Cypress for integration testing.
And styling was done through using styled component.

React was used because:
    It is easy to control states and pass components around.

Styled was used because:
    It is a descriptive way of styling and forces developer to be mindful + efficient with the amount of styling that is contained within each component.
    The usage of descriptive consts visually helps with clearity of what is displayed and the order it is displayed in.
    
Cypress E2E was used because:
    It helps to visually test and interact with the UI and test behaviors of the code.
